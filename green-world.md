# Go Green in 10 simple steps

1. Go Digital
- The more you do online, the less you need paper. Think about if you can send emails instead of letters or if you need to print files or if you can save them on your computer (or SharePoint if you’re based in a RLO office)

2. Switch lights off
- One of the simplest ways to reduce energy consumption is to switch lights off when you leave a room. If it’s sunny outside open up the blinds and make the most of natural light instead.

3. Reuse before recycle
- Before you get gung-ho about recycling think about can you re-use items first? Can you print on both sides of paper or can you re-use as scrap paper for note taking or shopping lists?

4. Get sharing
- Does everyone in the office or service need their own stapler, hole punch, scissors, etc? Of course not! Save money and unnecessary manufacture by using less in the first place. Rather than buying new stationery, see if you can get refills instead.

5. Switch computers off
- Both in services and offices make sure computers are switched off when you’re not using them rather than just leaving them on standby – you’d be amazed how much energy this saves!

6. Recycle

- Make sure you recycle what you can. RLO offices have green bins to recycle paper and most councils will collect recycled materials such as plastic and cardboard from residential services so make sure you sort out waste before throwing in the bin.

- 7. Cut unnecessary travel
- Consider if you can use the RLO Skype or teleconference facilities instead of travelling in the first place. Not only is this good for the environment but also saves you time and money too!

8. Save water
- Only use as much water as you need, saving both water and the energy needed to heat it when it comes to cups of tea and baths etc. Plus did you know you can get dual-flush toilets or water saving devices for toilet cisterns which reduce water per flush.

9. Green the commute
- Can you car share, use public transport, walk or ride a bike instead of jumping in the car? This often provides a great chance to integrate with the community or get to know your colleagues better too!

10. Bring your own lunch
- Bringing lunches to work in reusable containers is probably the greenest (and healthiest) way to eat at work. Buying lunches everyday almost inevitably ends up with a miniature mountain of packaging waste and is way more expensive than making your own too!
